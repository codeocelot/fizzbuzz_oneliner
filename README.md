# fizzbuzz_oneliner
Because students were using 20 precious lines to write fizzbuzz.  

## The Current Record: 
55 chars. Including `module.exports`.

## The Rules: 
Any es6 and lower syntax.  Must run on nodejs v4.2.1 with `--harmony` flag set. 
Your code must be exportable using CommonJS syntax.  In otherwords, it must be equivalent to `module.exports=`

## How to Validate

`node --harmony test.js`

The output of `wc -m` found inside test.js is considered official. 

Currently standing at 69 characters, set this Saturday morning.

How much lower can you go?
